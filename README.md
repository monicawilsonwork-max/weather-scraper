# Weather Scraper Project
# Weather-Scraper (Learning Series)

A beginner-friendly Python project where I’m practicing the fundamentals (variables, loops, functions) and preparing to build a real web scraper.

## What I built today
- `src/basics.py` – variables, loops, functions, plus a mini multiplication-table generator.
- Project structure with virtual environment and `.gitignore`.

### Demo
```bash
python src/basics.py
### Demo Screenshot
Here’s the project in action — code + output:

![Terminal window displaying Python code for a weather scraper and its output. The code defines variables, loops, and functions, and generates a multiplication table. Output below the code shows the multiplication table results. The environment is a typical code editor with a dark theme, evoking a focused and educational atmosphere.]
# Weather-Scraper (Learning Series)

This project marks the beginning of my hands-on journey into Python development. Starting with the fundamentals—variables, loops, and functions—I built a structured program that generates dynamic outputs like greetings, fruit counters, and multiplication tables. What excites me most is not just running Python code, but building real projects with professional folder organization, virtual environments, and version control. This repo reflects both my growth as a developer and my commitment to applying clean coding practices as I prepare to expand into data analysis, automation, and web scraping.
